### Dealer Listing Management

Dealer Listings Management provides a platform that can receive the listings from the dealers through different providers, and make them available on the platform.

* Dealer 	- The company that is publishing the car
* Listing	- The car that is being published
* Provider	- The platform the dealers already use to manage their own listings. Different providers send data in different formats, like CSV, JSON. 

Dealer Data Management enables dealers to get listings from different sources(providers) and make them available here in a standardized format.
